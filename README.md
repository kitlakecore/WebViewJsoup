# WebViewJsoup: A Powerful Android Library for Web Scraping

WebViewJsoup is an innovative Android library that seamlessly combines WebView and Jsoup to facilitate web scraping of websites protected by JavaScript challenges. In today's digital landscape, many websites employ JavaScript challenges as a security measure to prevent unauthorized data extraction. This can make traditional scraping methods, such as using Jsoup alone, ineffective in such scenarios. WebViewJsoup overcomes these challenges, empowering developers to effortlessly scrape the entire web page, even when protected by JavaScript challenges.

## The Challenge of JavaScript-Protected Websites

In contemporary web development, many websites employ JavaScript challenges to safeguard against unauthorized data extraction. Consequently, conventional scraping approaches, such as using Jsoup alone, encounter limitations in this scenario. WebViewJsoup effectively addresses this challenge, enabling successful scraping even when websites return a "Status: 403" error due to detected automated bot systems.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Enhanced Scraping Capability

WebViewJsoup enables web scraping on websites employing JavaScript challenges that would otherwise return a "Status: 403" error when using Jsoup alone.

### Seamless Integration

The library seamlessly integrates WebView and Jsoup to provide a smooth and efficient web scraping experience. By leveraging WebView to load the entire web page, WebViewJsoup ensures that all relevant content, including JavaScript-rendered elements, is accessible for further processing.

### Optimized Page Loading

We have meticulously optimized WebView settings to ensure speedy and successful page loading. The following settings are enabled by default to provide the best possible loading experience:

- JavaScript: Enabled
- DomStorage: Enabled
- LoadWithOverviewMode: Enabled
- UseWideView: Enabled
- BlockNetworkImage: Enabled
- CacheMode (LOAD_DEFAULT): Enabled
- UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0

### HTML Content Retrieval

Once the page is successfully loaded in WebView, WebViewJsoup effectively extracts the entire HTML content. To avoid any encoding issues in the HTML code, we utilize `StringEscapeUtils.unescapeJava(htmlContent)`, ensuring a robust foundation for further parsing.

### Easy Data Extraction

The retrieved HTML content is then seamlessly transferred to a Jsoup Document, providing users with a simple and familiar interface to extract the desired data from the web page.

## Integration and Usage

To benefit from the power of WebViewJsoup, developers need to add both the WebViewJsoup library and the Jsoup library to their Android projects. With this combination, they gain access to the versatile Jsoup Document, which can be utilized to process and extract data from the scraped web page.

## Performance

WebViewJsoup has been fine-tuned for optimal performance. On average, the entire scraping process takes a mere 0.5 milliseconds to 3 seconds to load a typical web page. Please note that actual loading times may vary depending on the complexity of the website and the amount of data present on the page.

## Conclusion

WebViewJsoup presents a powerful and reliable solution for web scraping in Android Studio projects, even on websites protected by JavaScript challenges. By skillfully integrating WebView and Jsoup, this library opens up new possibilities for developers seeking to access and extract valuable data from web pages.

**Please Note: Web scraping may have legal and ethical implications. Prior to employing WebViewJsoup to scrape any website, developers must ensure compliance with the website's terms of service and obtain proper authorization when required.**

For comprehensive implementation and usage guidelines, refer to the official WebViewJsoup documentation.

## How to Use WebViewJsoup in Your Project

To get a Git project into your build, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

**Step 2:** Add the dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.kitlakecore:WebViewJsoup:1.0.0'
    implementation 'org.jsoup:jsoup:1.14.3'
}
```

**Step 3:** Implement WebViewJsoup in your code

```java
private void startScraping() {
    WebViewJsoup webViewJsoup = new WebViewJsoup();

    webViewJsoup.runWebScraping(webView, url, new WebViewJsoup.WebScrapingCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onScrapingComplete(Document document) {
            String scrapedDoc = document.toString();
            Log.d("scrapedDoc", scrapedDoc);

            // Here you can start extracting data from Document
        }

        @Override
        public void onScrapingError(String errorMessage) {
            // Handle error, if any
        }
    });
}
```

Make use of the `WebViewJsoup.WebScrapingCallback` to process the scraped `Document` and extract the desired data from the web page.

Remember to refer to the official WebViewJsoup documentation for comprehensive implementation details.
